**Neural Network Model for Charity Donation Prediction**

Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to develop and optimize a deep learning model to predict whether applicants for charitable donations will receive funding. The objective is to achieve a predictive accuracy of at least 75% by experimenting with different model architectures and preprocessing techniques.

Data Preprocessing

Identifying Target and Feature Variables

Target Variable: IS_SUCCESSFUL (Binary classification: 1 for successful funding, 0 for unsuccessful)

Feature Variables: All remaining columns except for non-beneficial ones

Removed Variables: EIN and NAME, as they are not relevant to the prediction task

Data Cleaning and Transformation

Determined the number of unique values in each categorical column.

Consolidated infrequent categories into an "Other" category for application type and classification to improve model generalization.

Encoded categorical variables using pd.get_dummies().

Split the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80/20 ratio.

Scaled the feature variables using StandardScaler() to standardize input values for better model performance.

Model Development

Initial Model

Architecture:

Input layer with features from the dataset

Two hidden layers with ReLU activation

Output layer with a Sigmoid activation function

Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function

Performance: Initial accuracy was below 75%.

Model Optimization

First Optimization Attempt: Hyperparameter Tuning

Used Keras Tuner to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters.

Despite adjustments, accuracy remained below the target.

Second Model: Feature Engineering and Increased Neurons

Consolidated rare categories to reduce sparsity in categorical variables.

Increased neuron count in hidden layers to 100, 50, and 1.

Small accuracy improvement, but still below 75%.

Third Model: Additional Hidden Layer

Added a third hidden layer, modifying neuron counts to 80, 30, 15, and 1.

Performance improved slightly but did not reach the desired accuracy.

Additional Optimization Attempts

Adjusted the number of input features.

Added a fifth hidden layer.

Increased first hidden layer neurons to 100 and applied multiple combinations of neuron quantities across layers.

Increased training epochs.

None of these changes consistently achieved 75% accuracy.

Model Evaluation

The highest accuracy achieved remained below 75%, despite multiple optimization attempts.

Feature selection and dataset transformation may require further refinement to enhance predictive power.

Recommendations and Future Work

Try alternative activation functions such as Leaky ReLU or Swish to improve gradient flow.

Implement dropout layers to mitigate overfitting.

Explore different architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or ensemble learning methods.

Refine feature selection by using recursive feature elimination or principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the most impactful variables.

Experiment with different optimization algorithms such as RMSprop or Nadam.

Conclusion

Although the model did not reach the 75% accuracy threshold, various optimization attempts provided valuable insights into model tuning. Future approaches should focus on refining data preprocessing, testing additional neural network architectures, and exploring alternative machine learning models such as decision trees or ensemble methods like Random Forest and XGBoost for improved classification performance.
